# Python-Sum-Of-Two-Digit-Number-In-An-Array
Well, I had applied for a consideration to be part of the Andela Fellowship (Nairobi, Kenya). They then sent me a Codility Test Link where I had to take 3 tasks. 
had to take 3 tasks for 90 minutes.

There was this task where one is required to write  a solution that identuifies two digit number in an array and sums them up. I figured iut the code 
and submitted with a slight error that cost me 89% of the total task. Its painful! So here i decided to write the 100% Code in Python.
